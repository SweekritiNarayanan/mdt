# Melodic Discrimination Test (MDT)

R implementation of the adaptive Melodic Discrimination Test of Harrison, Collins, and Mullensiefen (2017).

This test is detailed in the following paper: Harrison, P. M. C., Collins, T., & Müllensiefen, D. (2017). 
Applying modern psychometric techniques to melodic discrimination testing: 
Item response theory, computerised adaptive testing, and automatic item generation. 
Scientific Reports, 7, 1–18. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-03586-z.

The implementation depends on a yet-to-be-released package, psychTestR. 
We hope to release psychTestR in the coming months.
In the meanwhile, if you would like to use the MDT for research purposes, 
please contact Peter at p.m.c.harrison@qmul.ac.uk.
